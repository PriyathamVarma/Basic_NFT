# Content addressing

## Content addressing motivation

![Content addressing](https://github.com/PriyathamVarma/Basic_NFT/blob/main/Diagrams/Content-addressing.drawio.png)

> Why location addressing fails?

- The URL points to a single copy stored in a single location
- The copy disappears, there is no way of knowing other copies locations.
- Malicious attacks on DNS


> The address of the content(fingerprint) is derived from the content itself and not from the location where it is stored.


### CID(Content Identifiers)

- Most fundamental for IPFS architecture.
- Used for content addressing
- Used to name every piece of data in IPFS
- A hash with some metadata

### Integrity Checking

The hash/fingerprint that is requested cannot be changed as every content is hashed and any change in the data automatically changes the entire hash. 

### IPFS components

#### Content Addressing

- Chunking
- Linking chunks in merkle DAGs
- From data to data structures with IPLD
- Anatomy of the IPFS CID

#### Content Discovery & Routing

- Routing & Provider records
- DHT-based Routing
- Gossip-based routing

#### Content Exchange

- Bitswap
- GraphSync

#### Mutable Names & Message Delivery

- Dynamic Data
- IPNS
- PubSub
- CRDTs.

## Content addressing in IPFS(Inter Planetary file system)

1. Chunking
2. Linking Chunks in Merkle DAGs
3. Going from data to data structures with IPLD
