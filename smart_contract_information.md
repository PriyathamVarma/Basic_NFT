# ERC-721 Smart contract Information

This article explains about the ERC-721 smart contracts and various functions associated with it.

## Most important functions

- Minting
- Burning
- Transfer


### Minting

Minting function helps in minting/creating the NFTs. For this we will be using openzeppelin standards. In the safemint method we need to give two parameters 
--> address of the person minting and token ID which is a counter of all NFT minted. So this basically creates an array of tokenIDS which are 
indexes associated with wallet addresses. Now, in setTokenURI we need to pass two parameters --> tokenID which will be helpful in referencing the addresses and uri of the 
token which is nothing but a link of the asset.

```
    function safeMint(address to, string memory uri) public onlyOwner {
    // tokenID is generated by counter library which automatically tracks the number
        uint256 tokenId = _tokenIdCounter.current();
    // Increment everytime the NFT is minted. Its important to note that NFT index starts with 1    
        _tokenIdCounter.increment();
        
    // _safeMint method with tokenID and to(wallet address) as arguments    
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
    // _setTokenURI method with tokenID and uri(possibly IPFS CID) as arguments     
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, uri);
    }

```
