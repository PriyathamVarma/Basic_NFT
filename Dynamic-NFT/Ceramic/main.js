/* There are two important things to talk about before moving on.

First: The DIDDatastore has two methods that allow writes to a data model:

merge(), which only writes to fields that have changed
set(), which overwrites ALL fields including those that have not changed. 
This can lead to data be removed in an unwanted way. It is recommended to use merge rather than set for that reason.

Second: Reading data from the DIDDatastore simply to render it to the DOM using renderProfileData() 
in this scenario is sub-optimal. There is no real need to read the data from Ceramic at this stage. 
This was included to show you how simple reading and writing can be, as each take one line when using the DIDDatastore. */
