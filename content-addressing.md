# Content addressing

## Content addressing motivation

* Why location addressing fails?

- The URL points to a single copy stored in a single location
- The copy disappears, there is no way of knowing other copies locations.
- Malicious attacks on DNS


> The address of the content(fingerprint) is derived from the content itself and not from the location where it is stored.


### CID(Content Identifiers)

- Most fundamental for IPFS architecture.
- Used for content addressing
- Used to name every piece of data in IPFS
- A hash with some metadata

### Integrity Checking

## Content addressing in IPFS(Inter Planetary file system)

1. Chunking
2. Linking Chunks in Merkle DAGs
3. Going from data to data structures with IPLD
